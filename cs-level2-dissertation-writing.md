== General tips for Dissertation Writing for Level 2 ==

=== Writing ===
* Write clearly and concisely. Avoid using many complicated words and overly long sentences, particularly if you are aware that your English skills are limited.
* Have every part of your dissertation proofread, ideally by different people.

=== Presenting designs ===
* Make diagrams easy to read and consistent.
* Justify _every_ design choice you make. Base as many of your justifications as you can on relevant literature sources.
* Discuss the merits and drawbacks of alternative designs.

=== Self reflections ===
* Avoid value judgements, such as "I did an outstanding job". Instead, provide specific examples of contributions and mention the observations upon which you base your self reflections.
