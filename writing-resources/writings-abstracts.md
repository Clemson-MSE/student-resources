# Writing titles

* The title needs to say what you have found, not what you have done.

# Tips for writing abstracts

* First sentence needs to convince reader to read second one.
* Second sentence needs to convince reader to care about the subject of the research.
* 3rd+ sentence, to tell what you have found, and how.
* Last sentence needs to link back to the wider picture in the first two sentences.
* Stick to the word limit at submission, but drafts may be longer.
* Abstracts should have one primary take-home message, that ideally can be condensed in a single sentence.
